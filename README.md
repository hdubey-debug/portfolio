## About me 
I am currently a researcher at the Intelligent Vision Systems Lab at South Dakota State University, under the guidance of Dr. Chulwoo Pack. My research is focused on advancing video comprehension by developing a mathematical framework to enhance the analysis and scoring of video summarization. In parallel, I am addressing critical challenges in large visual-language models (LVLMs), such as solving the lack of memory retention, enabling one-shot video question answering, and improving fine-grained video description.

In addition to my research in AI, I have a strong background in firmware and embedded systems engineering. I have worked at Amazon's Just Walk Out technology, where I developed firmware for their wireless networks, and at Trilliant Networks, where I contributed to the development of firmware for their mesh networks.
